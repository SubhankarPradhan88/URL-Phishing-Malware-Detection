# Secured Uniform Resource Locator (URL) Shortening Service Based On Phishing And Malware Detection Algorithm

This application can help users to be safe from the increasing phishing attacks.
The main agenda of this study was to identify if the website which the user is visiting is safe or not. 

**The scope of this research are as follows:**
1. To design and develop an application which will allow to shorten long URLs
2. Since by default the tool will generate random characters as names for the shortened URLs, the user will have the feasibility where they can provide customised names to the shortened URLs, so that the URLs not only looks neat but can also easily be remembered
3. Once the user will click the shortened URL’s names or copy the name and hit it in the browser, it will redirect back to the original long URL and will end up reaching the actual webpage
4. The tool will be able to provide the analytics on the user traffic based on the clicks that the actual URL receives
5. The tool will be integrated with the algorithm which would try to detect if the user entered long URL is malicious or is it safe to use. The tool will give warning if it come across any malicious URL and will let the user know if the URL entered to shorten is safe to use or not. This action will take place before the user saves the URLs in the database
8. The user entered long URLs’ domain will be compared with the data sets available for malicious or phish URLs like PhishTank etc. to check whether it is malicious or not
9. Action to copy the shortened URL and use it is present n the tool. Every-time the shortened URL gets hit, the click number keeps increasing
10. Delete action is available

**Steps to setup the project:**
1. Get the complete code base from the GitHub repository
2. Setting up the data base: We have used MongoDB (Atlas) in this project. In the file server.js for the const MONGODB_URI we need to provide our MongoDB cluster username and password in the path as shown below:
'mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.lrhlo.mongodb.net/urlShortener?retryWrites=true&w=majority';
3. Once the DB setup is done, we just need to run the command "npm run devStart" in the terminal and the application will start
